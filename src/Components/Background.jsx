                I was born in Stockholm in 1968. My first memory of music was listening to Bach's Jesus bleibet meine Freude. At the age of 11 I started playing the piano.
                In 1982, at the age of 14, I got my first computer - a Commodore-64. That started my love for programming. In 1986 I bought my first syntheseizer and drum machine - an Ensoniq ESQ-1 and a Roland TR-808.
                In 1988 I bought my first sampler - an Ensoniq EPS. My first job was at McDonalds in Kungsgatan, Stockholm. In 1996 the band I was in at the time recieved a record deal with Stockholm records. We released 2 singles. After that I started my career as a music producer.<br /><br />
                In 1997 I moved to Bussels to work with the team behind Rednex. After 2 intense years I moved back to Sweden and worked as a producer for Plugged Production and Fire Brigade International. I produced tracks for Rednex, Cool James & Black Teacher and worked as an recording engineer for A-teens.
                In 2002 my daughter was born. That lead me to start my journey to become a software developer.<br /><br />
                I studied computer science at KTH in Stockholm. I got my first job as a web developer at Projectplace in 2008. I coded the public website, both backend and frontend. I also worked as the Web Team Manager for 1 year.
                In 2016 I moved to Visma Consulting where I coded websites for clients like Apotek Hjärtat and Praktikertjänst and I also coded the public sites of Visma and Visma Opic. In 2018 I started working at Alecta where I coded the public site and the Mina sidor and Företag & Ombud sites. I created the site for Alecta Fastigheter from scratch working both with backend and frontend code. I was responsible for Google Analytics, Tag Manager and SEO. I also worked with the Selenium tests for Alecta.<br /><br />
                In my spare time I have coded games for windows using Unity, iPhone apps using SwitfUI, audio plugins using Juce & C++ and websites using React.<br />My hobbies include working out, playing chess and snooker. I can solve a rubiks cube in 30 seconds.
